The game title is called: Popping Mascots

The concept behind the game was to make the player spawn a bunch of iconic characters and people from the Nintendo industry through vibrant, colorful artwork created by me. 

The idea was to represent the art assets I have made in a way that makes the player interact with them.

To play the game, all you have to do is simply press the space bar. It is a microgame, so it is the one and only mechanic the player has.

It meets the assignment’s requirements because it was created in Unity 2D, is single player, is playable with a keyboard (space bar), takes no more than 10 seconds to complete due to the timer, has a two-second text informing the player what to do, has a clear win/loss state where you know you have to spawn at least ten mascots, has an “endgame” that shows if the player won or lost, is not a clone of a basic Unity tutorial or an assignment from a previous UCF class, and automatically closes shortly after showing if the player won or lost.

It meets the audio requirements because it has audio informing the player what to do, has copyright-free background music, has distinct and copyright-free sound effects for pressing the spacebar, and has copyright-free sound effects for win and loss states.

It meets the visual requirements because it has a background created by me, has sprites created by me, has 2D particle effects for when the player wins, and has a UI to indicate the timer.
